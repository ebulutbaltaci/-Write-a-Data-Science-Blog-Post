I used Boston Airbnb Dataset for this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Boston. The orijinal dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

This project focuses on answering following questions:

What are the most important factors in property valuation?

What are the factors in price determination?

What time of year has the highest rental prices?
